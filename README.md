# PyBer Ride Share Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
Company PyBer wants to analyze ride sharing data from various city types. After the initial analysis, the new challenge was to create a multi-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. This new analysis requires grouping the data based on the "type" and "date" to create a new DataFrame. Additionally, the "resample()" method was used to combine the data into weekly bins. Overall, the new challege gave PyBer another visual chart showing the weekly fares from January to April based on the city type.
